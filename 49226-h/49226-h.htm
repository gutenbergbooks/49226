<br />From the Portrait by Kneller.</p>

<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>Handel&rsquo;s long career resembles a gigantic tapestry,
so bewilderingly crowded with detail, so filled with
turmoil and vicissitude, with vast achievements,
extremes of good and ill fortune, and unending comings
and goings that any attempt to force even a small
part of it into the frame of a tiny, unpretentious booklet
of the present sort is as hopeless as it is presumptuous.
Handel is far more difficult to reduce to such
minuscule dimensions than his greatest contemporary,
Bach, whose worldly experiences were infinitely less
diverse and colorful, for all the sublimity, mystical
quality and epochal influence of his myriad creations.
The supreme master of florid pomp, Handel bulked
much larger in the perspective of his own day than
did, in his, the composer of the &ldquo;Passion According
to St. Matthew.&rdquo; In spite of an everlasting monument
like &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; the most popular choral masterpiece
ever written, we may, however, ask ourselves if the
body of Handel&rsquo;s music is as widely known and as
intimately studied as it deserves to be. How many
today can boast of a real acquaintance with Handel&rsquo;s
operas (there are more than forty of them alone)
apart from a few airs sung in concert; how many can
truly claim to know by experience any of the great
oratorios apart from &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; and, possibly, &ldquo;Judas
Maccabaeus&rdquo; and &ldquo;Israel in Egypt?&rdquo; Yet outside of
such monumental works, Handel was time and again
a composer of exquisitely delicate colorations, and
sensuous style, not to say a largely unsuspected master
of many subtle intricacies of rhythm. The present
pamphlet, wholly without originality or novelty of
approach, may, perchance, induce the casual reader
to renew his interest in Handel&rsquo;s prodigious treasury,
so much of it neglected, not to say actually undiscovered
by multitudes of music lovers.</p>

<h1 title="">George Frideric Handel</h1>
<p class="center"><i>By</i>
<br />HERBERT F. PEYSER</p>
<p>Some wit, comparing Bach and Handel, remarked
that both masters were &ldquo;born in the same year and
killed by the same doctor.&rdquo; Born in the same year
they unquestionably were, Handel almost an exact
month before his great contemporary. Halle, where
Handel first saw the light, is a comparatively short
distance from Eisenach, where Bach was cradled. It
lies not far from the eastern boundary of that Saxon-Thuringian
country which harbored some of the imposing
musical figures of Germany during the 17th
Century. Such names as those of the famous &ldquo;three
S&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;Schein, Scheidt and Sch&uuml;tz&mdash;of Kuhnau,
Krieger, Melchior Franck, Ahle, Rosenm&uuml;ller, echo
powerfully through the history of that period.</p>
<p>George Frideric Handel was born on Monday,
February 23, 1685. That the name has been variously
spelled need not trouble us; strict consistency in such
matters lay as lightly on folks of this epoch as it did
in the age of Mozart. However, it may be pointed out
that in this booklet &ldquo;Frideric&rdquo; is retained in place of
&ldquo;Frederick&rdquo; because Handel himself repeatedly used
this form and because the British authorities thus
inscribed him when he became a British citizen.</p>
<p>The Handel family came from Silesia, where Valentine
Handel, the composer&rsquo;s grandfather, had been a
coppersmith in Breslau. George Handel, the father,
had been &ldquo;barber-surgeon,&rdquo; attached to the service of
Saxon and Swedish armies, then to that of Duke
Augustus of Saxony. For a time he prospered and in
1665 he bought himself &ldquo;Am Schlamm,&rdquo; at Halle-an-der-Saale,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
a palatial house, which in the course of
years barely escaped total destruction by fire. In any
case, Father Handel was to know the ups and downs
of fortune; and the vicissitudes he endured did not
sweeten an always morose and surly character. He
has been described as &ldquo;a strong man, a man of vast
principles, bigoted, intensely disagreeable, a man with
a rather withered heart.&rdquo; A portrait of him gave
Romain Rolland &ldquo;the impression of one who has
never smiled.&rdquo; He was twice married, the first time to
the widow of a barber, a woman ten years his senior,
the second to Dorothea Taust, a pastor&rsquo;s daughter,
thirty years his junior. By the first he had six children,
by the second four, of whom George Frideric was
the second.</p>
<p>Father Handel was 63 when his great son came
into the world. The future composer of &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; was
born, not in the elaborate edifice which carries his
bust and is inscribed with the titles of his oratorios,
but in the house adjoining it which stands on a street
corner and whose official address is Nicolai Strasse 5.
Yet even this statement must be qualified. For this
presumable &ldquo;birthplace&rdquo; was not built till 1800 and,
according to the researches of Newman Flower, stands
on the <i>site</i> of the house in which Handel was born.
As for the town of Halle, it had definitely passed
after the death of the Duke Augustus of Saxony, to
Brandenburg; so that, strictly speaking, Handel was
born a Prussian. But, as Rolland has noted, &ldquo;the
childhood of Handel was influenced by two intellectual
forces: the Saxon and the Prussian. Of the two
the more aristocratic, and also most powerful was the
Saxon.&rdquo; At all events, after the Thirty Years&rsquo; War
the city of Halle, during the Middle Ages a center
of culture and gaiety, had fallen into a drab provincialism.</p>

<p>Apparently the child&rsquo;s musical susceptibilities
developed early and rather like Mozart&rsquo;s, even if
unlike the latter, he had not the benefit of a friendly
and understanding father. Who has not seen at
some time or other the picture immortalizing the
precocity of &ldquo;the Infant Handel?&rdquo; The story goes
that the indulgent mother had smuggled a clavichord
into the garret. In the dead of night the child crept
to the attic till the father, aroused by faint tinklings,
came with a lantern to investigate. Whether or
not the clavichord was confiscated the result of the
parental raid was a stern prohibition of all sorts of
music-making. Some of us may be reminded by this
apparent heartlessness of a rather similar punishment
visited on the youthful Bach, when his elder brother
deprived him of music he had painfully copied out
by moonlight for his own use.</p>
<p>The elder Handel&rsquo;s motive was, according to his
own lights, perhaps quite as defensible. He had no
wish to see a son of his degraded to the rank of a
lackey or some form of vagabond, than which a
musician at that time hardly seemed any better. The
barber-surgeon fully shared the prejudice of the average
&ldquo;strong man&rdquo; against the artist. Rolland describes
the bourgeois middle class German attitude of the
17th Century on the subject of music: &ldquo;It was for
them a mere art of amusement, and not a serious
profession. Many of the masters of that time, Sch&uuml;tz,
Kuhnau, Rosenm&uuml;ller, were lawyers or theologians,
before they devoted themselves to music.&rdquo; And old
George Handel is supposed to have threatened: &ldquo;If
that boy ever shows any further inclination towards
music or noises disguised as such, I will kill it!&rdquo; There
was, indeed, one way in which the boy could with a
certain impunity satisfy his craving for music&mdash;in
church, by listening to the organ and the singing of
the choir. Such enjoyment supplanted to some extent
the games and childish pleasures of ordinary boys.
He was, it appears, a somewhat lonely child, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
made few friends and whose &ldquo;playground&rdquo; was a
dismal courtyard opposite his home.</p>
<p>The father settled on the law as a fine, honest and
lucrative profession for his son. Jurisprudence was to
rescue Handel from the snares of music, just as in
time it was to be the &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; of Schumann, as
school mastering was by paternal decree to be the
destiny of Schubert, and medicine that of Berlioz.
Here, too, it was quite as ineffectual! All the same,
the youth was not to escape his share of legal study;
and by the time he reached 16 he entered the University
of Halle as &ldquo;studiosus juris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About eight years earlier, however, fate in the
paradoxical shape of Father Handel himself took a
hand in George Frideric&rsquo;s future. He had his son
accompany him on a journey to nearby Weissenfels,
the residence of the Duke of Saxony. That personage
asked the lad to play something on the chapel organ
and was so stirred by what he heard that he counselled
the obdurate father not to thwart the child&rsquo;s
ambition. From an ordinary person the hard-boiled
parent would have taken such advice in very bad part;
coming from the mouth of a prince it acquired the
force of a command. So he decided to allow his son to
study music with the unspoken reservation, however,
that he must belong first and foremost to the law.
Actually, these musical studies might be said to have
begun in Weissenfels, for here young Handel had a
chance to hear some of the works of the N&uuml;rnberg
master, Johann Krieger; and in this same town, a mere
stone&rsquo;s throw from Halle, he had his first taste of
opera, which was to thrust deep roots in his soul.</p>
<p>The boy was now entrusted to the care of Friedrich
Wilhelm Zachow, from Leipzig, who at an early age
had become organist of the Halle Liebfrauenkirche.
Zachow appears to have been an uncommonly gifted
teacher and Handel&rsquo;s devotion to him never wavered.
As we read Romain Rolland&rsquo;s words we are strangely
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
reminded of the ideals and methods of Theodor Weinlig,
Wagner&rsquo;s unique master of composition: &ldquo;Zachow&rsquo;s
first efforts were devoted to giving the pupil a strong
foundation in harmony. Then he turned his thoughts
towards the inventive side of the art; he showed him
how to give his musical ideas the most perfect form,
and he refined his taste. He possessed a remarkable
library of Italian and German music, and he explained
to Handel the various methods of writing and composing
adopted by different nationalities, whilst pointing
out the good qualities and the faults of each composer
and in order that his education might be at
the same time theoretical and practical, he frequently
gave him exercises to work in such and such a style....
Thus the little Handel had, thanks to his master,
a living summary of the musical resources of Germany,
old and new; and under his direction he
absorbed all the secrets of the great contrapuntal
architects of the past, together with the clear expressive
and melodic beauty of the Italian-German schools of
Hanover and Hamburg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Around 1696 George Frideric is supposed to have
gone to Berlin, though about this and possibly a
subsequent trip a short time afterwards the chronicles
give no clear account. Father Handel was seriously ill
and, as it is unlikely that the 11-year-old student went
to the Court of the Elector of Brandenburg alone, the
assumption is that he made the journey in Zachow&rsquo;s
company. Be this as it may, the artistic enthusiasm of
the Electress, Sophia Charlotte, stimulated musical
activities at the electoral court and attracted thither
outstanding Italian composers, instrumentalists and
singers. And it may well have been here that the
youth was first brought into contact with the music
of the South. He played on the clavecin before a
princely audience and stirred it to such enthusiasm
that the Elector wished to take him into service or
at least finance a trip to Italy, to complete his studies.
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
But if we are to believe Mainwaring, Father Handel
did not wish his son &ldquo;tied too soon to a prince.&rdquo;
Furthermore, the old man&rsquo;s health failed so alarmingly
that he knew his days were numbered and wished to
see the boy once more before he died.</p>
<p>Hardly was George Frideric back in Halle when
the barber-surgeon went to his account. The youth
wrote a memorial poem which was published in a
pamphlet and proved to be the first time his name
ever appeared in print. After settling her husband&rsquo;s
affairs Dorothea Handel went about carrying out his
wishes regarding her son&rsquo;s legal studies. In a spirit
of duty he continued them a while; but soon after his
completion of his college classes and his entrance for
the Faculty of Law at the Halle University music
gained the upper hand completely. He was religious
without sentimentality but as little as the youthful
Bach did he have any sympathy with Pietism (of
which the Faculty of Theology was a hot-bed at the
time) and was violently opposed to the Pietist antagonism
to music. And when the post of organist at
the Cathedral &ldquo;by the Moritzburg&rdquo; fell vacant by reason
of the dissolute habits of a roystering individual
named Leporin, Handel was made his successor,
though the church was Calvinist and the young newcomer
a staunch Lutheran.</p>
<p>There was now an end to all thoughts of jurisprudence.
Music claimed him solely. Handel was only
17 but seems already to have exercised a strong
musical authority in Halle. He assembled a capital
choir and orchestra from among his most gifted pupils
and let them be heard on Sundays in various churches
of the town. Like Bach and other masters of that
astonishing period, he composed an incredible number
of cantatas, motets, psalms, chorales and devotional
miscellany, which had to be new every week. It must
not be imagined that he allowed them to wilt or evaporate.
Handel&rsquo;s mind was a storehouse, whence nothing
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
ever escaped and in which was always stocked away
and held in reserve for future use.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1703 he left his native city; not,
indeed, forever, but only for occasional visits to relatives
and friends, when professional business allowed
him time. From Halle he turned his steps toward
Hamburg, which had suffered little from the wars of
the 17th Century, and grown rich, gay and artistic
in consequence of enviable business prosperity. Commercial
benefits were, of course, reflected in a musical
expansion which raised the Hanseatic port above the
level even of Berlin and made it the operatic city of
the North. In Hamburg, notes Rolland, &ldquo;they spoke
all languages and especially the French tongue; it was
in continual relationship with both England and Italy,
and particularly with Venice, which constituted for it
a model for emulation. It was by way of Hamburg
that the English ideas were circulated in Germany....
In the time of Handel, Hamburg shared with Leipzig
the intellectual prestige of Germany. There was no
other place in Germany where music was held in such
high esteem. The artists there hobnobbed with the rich
merchants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hamburg opera catered to various factions
which did not invariably see eye to eye. One of these
factions consisted of persons who sought in operatic
entertainment out and out amusement; the other, of
individuals with a religious bent, who regarded the
average fantastic and extravagant opera as an invention
of hell&mdash;<i>opera diabolica</i>. When Handel arrived
the lyric theatre was making history guided by the
composer, Reinhard Keiser. Under Keiser&rsquo;s management
Hamburg became a home of opera in the German
tradition. Some of these &ldquo;German&rdquo; operas were
coarse and in atrocious taste. Hugo Leichtentritt tells,
for instance, of a work called &ldquo;St&ouml;rtebeker und G&ouml;dge
Michaelis&rdquo; (music by Keiser), a story about piracy
on the high seas, with executions and massacres, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
which bladders filled with sow blood and concealed
beneath the costumes of the actors would be perforated
in such a manner that the appalled spectators
were spattered with a gory shower, often resulting
in a stampede.</p>
<p>Keiser, though a person of unstable character and
extreme presumptuousness, had indisputable genius.
He was not yet 30 when Handel came to Hamburg
and under him that city experienced its golden age
of opera. To be sure, the weakest feature of the Hamburg
Opera was the singing. For a long time the institution
had no <i>professional</i> singers. The roles were
taken by students, shoemakers, tailors, fruiterers &ldquo;and
girls of little talent and less virtue,&rdquo; while ordinarily
artisans &ldquo;found it more convenient to take female
parts.&rdquo; A gifted Kapellmeister named Cousser, who
had been a pupil of Lully in Paris, introduced important
reforms and when Handel in 1703 arrived the
moment was, in truth, a psychological one. &ldquo;He was
rich in power and strong in will,&rdquo; wrote the 22-year-old
Johann Mattheson, the first acquaintance he was
to make in Hamburg. Rolland pictures Handel as
having &ldquo;an ample forehead, a vigorous mouth, a full
chin and a head covered with a biretta&rdquo; (rather after
the manner of Wagner, of whom throughout his life
Handel reminds one in some amazing traits of character
and genius).</p>
<p>Under Keiser the adventurous newcomer soon
found employment as a second violin in the opera
orchestra. His particular intimate was Mattheson, a
musician of many gifts and uncommon versatility,
who united in himself literary talents, a critical flair
and a highly volatile temperament. It was he who
helped Handel find pupils and who guided him into
the town&rsquo;s important musical circles. So that before
long Handel had access to the organ lofts of Hamburg&rsquo;s
churches and opportunities to compose works
for ecclesiastical purposes. Mattheson, incidentally,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
was a linguist and spoke perfect English; and it was
through him that Handel was to enter for the first time
into negotiations with what was to become his second
country.</p>
<p>It was not very long, however, before the temperaments
and idiosyncrasies of the two brought them
into collision. Mattheson criticised the music of his
friend, perhaps not entirely without reason, complained
that Handel was not the most perfect of
melodists and that he often wrote at too great length.
If these opinions may have nettled the younger man
they were not wholly lost on him, as time was to show.
In the early months of their friendship Handel and
Mattheson went to L&uuml;beck to listen to the playing
of the renowned Danish organist, Dietrich Buxtehude,
whose celebrated Abendmusiken at the Marienkirche
were likewise a magnet which drew Bach away from
his duties in Arnstadt. The young men were deeply
stirred by the music of the venerable master and
Handel stored away in his incredibly retentive memory
ideas which were to fertilize his imagination in later
years. The two youths actually competed for the post
of organist and might, like Bach, have won it but for
the provision that whoever succeeded a retiring organist
in L&uuml;beck had to marry the daughter&mdash;or widow&mdash;of
his predecessor. In this case the daughter seems
to have been more than usually undesirable and, like
their famous contemporary, the excursionists from
Hamburg turned their backs on L&uuml;beck.</p>
<p>Presently the friendship was imperiled once more,
this time with what might have been disastrous results.
In October, 1704, an opera, &ldquo;Cleopatra&rdquo; which
Mattheson had composed to a text by a certain Friederick
Feustkling, was produced with the composer in
the part of Mark Antony and Handel at the harpsichord.
The piece won a success, but on a later occasion
Mattheson (Antony being &ldquo;dead&rdquo;) hastened into the
orchestra and tried to push Handel from the instrument.
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
A quarrel flared up immediately, which seems to
have broken up the performance and have lasted half
an hour. In the end the throng repaired to the G&auml;nsemarkt,
outside the theatre, the pair drew swords
and set upon one another. Almost at once the combat
came to an end, Mattheson&rsquo;s blade splintering against
a metal button on Handel&rsquo;s coat. &ldquo;The duel might
have ended very badly for us both, if by God&rsquo;s mercy
my sword had not broken,&rdquo; the young firebrand was
to write later. The reconciliation was not immediate
but when it did come about the two dined together,
then betook themselves to the theatre to a rehearsal
of Handel&rsquo;s first opera, &ldquo;Almira.&rdquo; The representation,
on January 8, 1705, was an instant triumph for
its composer. The Hamburgers were completely captivated
by the freshness and manifest genius which the
score exhibited. Mattheson had sung the tenor part
but does not seem to have been overjoyed by his
friend&rsquo;s spectacular success.</p>
<p>Handel was spurred by his fortunate operatic
debut to embark on a second work. The fact
that &ldquo;Almira&rdquo; had been sung partly in Italian, partly
in German, did not keep it from obtaining twenty
performances at the outset. Handel made the mistake
of interrupting its run because he believed that in his
next opera, &ldquo;Nero, or Love Obtained Through Blood
and Murder,&rdquo; he had written something better.
Mattheson sang the part of Nero; but the opera died
after only three hearings. To aggravate matters the
Keiser regime, now largely discredited, gave promise
of putting an end to the Hamburg Opera; and Handel
began to see himself enmeshed in the catastrophe of
the wreck, a victim of elaborate jealousies and
intrigues.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>In 1704 he had made the acquaintance of an Italian
prince, Giovanni Gaston del Medici, an adventurer
and a notorious profligate, whose father was Grand
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Duke of Tuscany. He was astonished that Handel
seemed so little interested in Italian music, including
some specimens he set before him. Handel insisted
that &ldquo;angels would be necessary to sing them if such
stuff were to sound even agreeable.&rdquo; At this time his
ambition was to create a German style, independent
of foreign influences. And for Keiser&rsquo;s successor,
Saurbrey, Handel turned out a new opera, &ldquo;Florindo
und Daphne&rdquo;, which, like Wagner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rienzi&rdquo;, proved
to be so long that the composer caused it to be given
in two parts, &ldquo;for fear&rdquo;, he admitted, &ldquo;that the music
might tire the hearers.&rdquo; Then, without taking leave of
Mattheson or any of his friends, he accepted the
prince&rsquo;s invitation and went to Italy.</p>
<p>More or less mystery surrounds Handel&rsquo;s arrival in
Italy, though the time was not exactly propitious, what
with the War of the Spanish Succession in full blast
and funds in the wanderer&rsquo;s pocket fairly low. But
the composer did not tarry in Florence, his first stop,
for long and early in 1707 went to Rome. From the
operatic standpoint the Eternal City had nothing to
interest him. Pope Innocent III ten years previously
deciding that the opera house was immoral, had closed
it; then when things promised to improve a bit
for musicians a devastating earthquake renewed the
religious qualms of the people, so that during the
whole of Handel&rsquo;s Italian sojourn, Rome had not a
single performance of opera. However, there was
abundant church and chamber music, which spurred
him to emulation. To the Easter festivities of April,
1707, he contributed a &ldquo;Dixit Dominus&rdquo; and a few
months later he wrote a &ldquo;Laudate Pueri&rdquo; and other
Latin Psalms. But more important for his future were
the excellent connections he made. Letters of recommendation
from the Medici prince opened the Roman
salons to him; and in such aristocratic circles his
virtuosity on the keyboard seems to have gained him
more fame than even his compositions. &ldquo;The famous
Saxon&rdquo; (&ldquo;Il Sassone famoso&rdquo;), as Handel was called
among the Romans even as early as the summer of
1707, was the wonder of musical soirees. And he was
making inestimable artistic friendships. When we note
that among those with whom he was brought into
contact at one time or another in Rome included the
Scarlattis, father and son; Arcangelo Corelli, Bernardo
Pasquini, Benedetto Marcello&mdash;to mention only a few&mdash;we
can judge to what grandly fertilizing inspirations
Handel was exposed. We must mention in passing
Cardinals Panfili and Ottoboni, as well as the Marquis
Ruspoli, who yielded to nobody in his enthusiasm for
Handel&rsquo;s gifts. All these men belonged to a coterie
called the &ldquo;Arcadians&rdquo;, which united &ldquo;the nobility and
the artists in a spiritual fraternity not only the most
illustrious artists and aristocrats of Italy, but further
included four Popes and members of foreign royalty.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">HANDEL AT THE TIME OF HIS FIRST VISIT TO ITALY.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The &ldquo;Arcadians&rdquo; held weekly meetings at the palace
of Cardinal Ottoboni, where poetic and musical improvisations
were given. It was for the concerts in
the Ottoboni home that Handel composed his two
Roman oratorios, &ldquo;The Resurrection&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Triumph of Time and Truth&rdquo;, which approximate
operas and the second of which was to undergo several
transformations during his career. In the Ottoboni
palace later took place that celebrated contest between
Handel and the incomparable Domenico Scarlatti,
which was adjudged a draw. The heart-warming
friendship between the two masters was to endure for
years. It is by no means out of the question that in
the un-operatic atmosphere of Rome Handel, nevertheless,
began to compose the first of his Italian operas,
&ldquo;Roderigo&rdquo;, which was heard for the first time only
when he returned to Florence in the autumn of 1707.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Handel was not to leave Italy till some time during
the late spring of 1710, yet there are not a few blanks
in his Italian travels, which it is impossible to fill out.
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
He worked as industriously as ever&mdash;composed,
played, absorbed myriad impressions. In Florence
&ldquo;Roderigo&rdquo; had a success which it was claimed by
some had been achieved partly through the favor of
the Grand Duke and the love of a prima donna, Vittoria
Tarquini. Possibly it was furthered by the latter
but certainly not caused by it. Handel&rsquo;s life is conspicuously
free from conventional &ldquo;love interest&rdquo;; and
perhaps the most celebrated story of his dealings with
women is the one which tells of his raging threat to
throw the soprano, Francesca Cuzzoni, out of a window
if she did not sing exactly as he wanted what
he had written for her. Certainly the middle-aged
Tarquini never attracted him physically.</p>
<p>Encouraged by his Florentine luck Handel was
moved to try his fortunes in Venice, where opera
houses had sprung up everywhere and at one time
numbered fifteen. Seven were playing on one and the
same evening during Carnival time and there were
musical diversions or solemnities of one sort or another
in churches and in those women&rsquo;s conservatories called
&ldquo;hospitals&rdquo;. Venice was then the musical capital of
Italy, somewhat as Milan was to become at a later
date. Handel does not appear to have contributed to
the operatic life of the city at this time but his chance
was to come before long. Yet he did make one
encounter in Venice which was to have consequences&mdash;he
met Ernest Augustus, Prince of Hanover,
and the Duke of Manchester, English Ambassador
Extraordinary. He went back to Rome (where an
unsuccessful attempt was made to convert him to
Catholicism); yet he loved the city and regretfully
tore himself away from it to make a jaunt to Naples,
which contributed importantly to his artistic sensibilities.
As he had done elsewhere in Italy he haunted
the picture galleries and nourished his enthusiasm for
paintings. He assimilated the Spanish and French
musical styles which &ldquo;fought for honors in this city&rdquo;;
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
saw much of Alessandro Scarlatti, interested himself
in the folk music of the place, noted down the melodies
of the Calabrian Pifferari, met the Venetian
Cardinal Grimani, composed for the Neapolitan
&ldquo;Arcadians&rdquo; the <i>serenata</i> &ldquo;Acis and Galatea&rdquo;. Grimani,
whose family owned the theatre of San Giovanni
Crisostomo in Venice, supplied him with the libretto
of an opera, &ldquo;Agrippina&rdquo;, which Handel probably
began to compose on the spot. Its performance in
Venice was as good as assured and from Naples he
returned to Rome, making another useful friend in
the Bishop Agostino Steffani, who was charged with
secret missions by different German princes and held
at the same time the post of Kapellmeister at the
Court of Hanover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agrippina&rdquo; was produced in Venice, 1709-10. Its
reception exceeded anything the composer had known
till then. The chronicles tell of cries of &ldquo;Viva il caro
Sassone&rdquo;, also of &ldquo;extravagances impossible to record.&rdquo;
Obviously his travels in the peninsula had superbly
enriched his creative powers and the Venetians found
the new work &ldquo;the most melodious of Handel&rsquo;s Italian
operas.&rdquo; Nor was its popularity confined to Venice.
He seems to have had some idea of going to Paris,
became familiar with the French language, used it in
his correspondence and Romain Rolland describes his
style as &ldquo;always very correct and having the fine
courtesy of the Court of Louis XIV.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Handel did not go to France. Instead, he
returned to Germany and went to Hanover. Prince
Ernest had, in Venice, been completely captivated by
&ldquo;Agrippina&rdquo; and repeated an invitation he had made
once before. The worthy Steffani invited the &ldquo;dear
Saxon&rdquo; to succeed him as Kapellmeister at the
Hanoverian Court. Wisely, &ldquo;the dear Saxon&rdquo; accepted.
How differently things might have turned had he not
been in Venice at just that providential moment! So
Handel, as Chrysander said, &ldquo;walked in the steps of
Steffani; but his feet were larger.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">Showing Handel&rsquo;s handwriting and signature when he first came to London.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>His stay in Hanover in 1710 was brief. Hardly had
he prepared to take up his duties than proposals were
made to him from England. He asked leave of absence
and received it; accepted an invitation from the
Elector Johann Wilhelm to visit his court at D&uuml;sseldorf;
and then, by way of Holland, traveled to London,
which he reached late in 1710, unable to speak a
word of English. Before he had gone back to the
Hanoverian Court he had written an opera, produced
it amid prodigious enthusiasm and taken the first steps
toward becoming a sovereign British institution.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>He could not have timed his coming better. Purcell&rsquo;s
death sixteen years earlier had given what was something
like a death blow to English music; and what
now passed for native compositions amounted to
pitiable odds and ends. Rolland ridicules the claim of
some unthinking people that Handel &ldquo;killed English
music since there was nothing left to kill.&rdquo; A renewal
of the Puritanical opposition which poisoned the
English stage contributed to the confusion and discouragement
of British artists, and the worst of such
attacks as the notorious Jeremy Collier had made on
the &ldquo;profaneness and immorality&rdquo; of the theatre lay
in the fact that, as such things often do, they expressed
the deep feelings of the nation. In consequence of a
universal hypocrisy foreign elements came to fill the
vacuum created. Some bad Italian librettos were set
to wretched music and served up with momentary
success. Other &ldquo;entertainments&rdquo; of the sort mingled
Italian and English words and were duly satirized by
the jealous and priggish Joseph Addison, nettled by
the failure of his own piece, &ldquo;Rosamund&rdquo;, to which
one Thomas Clayton had composed atrocious music.</p>
<p>Handel came into contact with one Aaron Hill, who
managed the Queen&rsquo;s Theatre in the Haymarket, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
received from him an opera text, &ldquo;Rinaldo&rdquo;, which an
Italian, Giacomo Rossi, had adapted from Tasso&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Jerusalem Delivered.&rdquo; The new arrival rose magnificently
to his opportunity. The music was completed
in just two weeks and performed on February 24,
1711. And luck aided Handel by supplying him with
some extraordinary singers, all of them new to England&mdash;Giuseppe
Boschi, a young and astounding
bass, and the sensational castrato, Nicolini, who took
London by storm. The tale of &ldquo;Rinaldo&rdquo; was that of
the Venetian &ldquo;Agrippina&rdquo; all over again! In one evening
the British capital was subjugated, for all the bile
and venom Addison and Steele could discharge into
the columns of <i>The Spectator</i> and <i>The Tatler</i>. The
melodies of the opera spread like wildfire and seem
to have appealed to the lower classes as well as to
the aristocracy. To this day some of them have preserved
their vitality. The noble air, &ldquo;Lascia ch&rsquo;io
pianga&rdquo;, in sarabande rhythm, is a fairly familiar item
on recital programs; and the Crusaders&rsquo; March, a
fine, swinging tune, was adapted to the words &ldquo;Let
us take the road&rdquo; by Dr. Pepusch when he assembled
out of countless folksongs and dances John Gay&rsquo;s
deathless &ldquo;Beggar&rsquo;s Opera&rdquo;&mdash;in 1728 a thorn in Handel&rsquo;s
side but still, after more than two centuries, a
classic with an iron constitution.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Roughly speaking, Handel composed forty-four
operas from &ldquo;Almira&rdquo;, in 1705, at Hamburg to &ldquo;Deidamia&rdquo;,
1741, in London. It is obviously impossible
to consider even a small fraction of them here and
we shall have to content ourselves with little more
than the names and dates of only a few. All the same,
it may be well to pause here momentarily to ask ourselves
what, in the first place, a Handel opera really
is like. For unless we are specialists, not to say antiquarians,
we have little means of definitely knowing.
The lyric drama of that period cannot be judged by
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
the works of the 19th and 20th Centuries or even by
more than a scant handful of masterpieces of Gluck
and Mozart. Its problems, its musical and dramatic
aspects are basically different. A movement, which
had its rise in Germany after the First World War
and which continued on and off for several years (even
spreading intermittently to other countries, including
the United States) demonstrated that these baroque
entertainments are essentially museum pieces, prizable
as certain of their elements may be. To us, who have
been nurtured on the theatre works of Mozart, of the
composers of the school of dramatic and pictorial
&ldquo;grand opera&rdquo;, of the opera buffa and the op&eacute;ra
comique, the <i>drame lyrique</i> of Gounod and Bizet,
the works of Verdi, the music dramas of Wagner and
his assorted successors of various nationalities&mdash;to
us the operatic specimens of Handel seem infinitely
alien and remote in their premises and calculated
stylizations. The nearest we can approach them today
is through such surviving examples of the old <i>opera
seria</i> as Mozart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Idomeneo&rdquo; or Gluck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alceste&rdquo;.
And even those do not supply genuine parallels.</p>
<p>To the average person reared on the lyric drama
as known to two or three generations preceding ours
the long-established description of a Handelian opera
as a &ldquo;concert in costume&rdquo; may suffice at a pinch. But
in a larger sense it begs the question, for Handel&rsquo;s
forty odd operas are both more than this and less.
We should find their librettos so cut to a pattern that
the most old-fashioned &ldquo;books&rdquo; of the 19th Century
would possibly strike us, by comparison, dramatically
bold, even involved. Handelian operas have no trace
of psychological subtlety or elementary &ldquo;conflict&rdquo;.
What theatrical &ldquo;action&rdquo; there is passes before us with
something like lightning speed. Incidents which need
to be communicated to the spectator are, in the main,
recounted in recitative. What we understand as &ldquo;incident&rdquo;
is subordinate to phases of emotional expression;
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
and in ensemble pieces. Joy, rage, sadness, a broad
scale of elemental feelings, are recognizably embodied
in musical moods and tempos unmistakable in their
lyrical or dramatic communications of &ldquo;affetti&rdquo;
(&ldquo;emotions&rdquo;). There is little, if indeed any, of what a
later esthetic was to call &ldquo;the art of transition&rdquo; and
it was nothing in any manner unusual for a fiery or
combative <i>presto</i> to precede (or follow) a tender <i>largo</i>
or <i>andante</i>, and other formalistic clich&eacute;s. The accompaniment,
the orchestra, indeed the &ldquo;action&rdquo; and the
stage picture is not much more than incidental background
and frame.</p>
<p>The true center of gravity of a Handel opera lies
in the performance of the singers and their command
of declamation, florid utterance, sustained song and
artifices at that epoch accepted as supremely expressive.
Only in grasping these facts can we put ourselves
in the frame of mind needed to understand the essential
principles of these baroque masterpieces and
to appreciate what&mdash;apart from their sheer melodic

<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Having conquered England at a blow and become
the idol not only of high society but of the common
people as well, Handel recalled in the spring of 1711
that he was still Kapellmeister of Hanover. In London
he had made enemies as well as friends and one of the
most implacable of his foes was the great but churlish
Addison. His admirers, on the other hand, included
a child named Mary Granville, later Mrs. Delany, one
of his staunchest friends; the Duke of Burlington,
through whom he had entr&eacute;e to Burlington House;
and the famous eccentric, Thomas Britton, a coal
dealer by day but who, on certain evenings, sponsored
memorable concerts in a specially outfitted loft above
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
his coal shop, which drew prominent London musicians
and cultured aristocrats to the Clerkenwell &ldquo;garret&rdquo;,
where Handel frequently appeared as harpsichord
and even organ virtuoso.</p>
<p>Back in Hanover June, 1711, he renewed his contacts
with Bishop Steffani, composed organ concertos and
other chamber music, as well as a quantity of songs
to German texts by the Hamburg Senator, Brockes.
He would have liked to produce &ldquo;Rinaldo&rdquo; but the
Hanover Opera was closed. Yet London had entered
his blood and nothing would content him but his
speedy return, the more so because his English
admirers demanded him. He obtained leave &ldquo;on condition
that he return to Hanover after a reasonable
time&rdquo;; and by November, 1712, he arrived in England
to supervise preparations for a pastoral, &ldquo;Il Pastor
Fido&rdquo;, a work hastily thrown together and variously
improved more than twenty years later. This time
Handel did not repeat his &ldquo;Rinaldo&rdquo; sensation and the
piece had only half a dozen hearings. To make matters
worse, a certain MacSwiney, who succeeded Aaron
Hill at the Queen&rsquo;s Theatre, absconded, leaving
nothing but unpaid bills and enraged singers. At this
stage there enters the picture a Swiss adventurer, by
name Heidegger, a man of unbelievable conceit and
homeliness, who was, however, to play an important
role in Handel&rsquo;s future. To recoup the failure of &ldquo;Il
Pastor Fido&rdquo; the composer turned out in less than three
weeks a &ldquo;tragic opera&rdquo; in five acts, &ldquo;Teseo&rdquo;, with a
libretto by Nicolo Francesco Haym, and dedicated
tactfully to the Earl of Burlington. &ldquo;Teseo&rdquo; came near
duplicating the fortunes of &ldquo;Rinaldo&rdquo;; and if, as Rolland
says, it was &ldquo;full of haste&rdquo;, it was also &ldquo;full of
genius.&rdquo; If anything could have intrenched the composer
still more firmly in London it was this opera. He
went for a while to live at Burlington House at the
Duke&rsquo;s invitation; met Pope, Gay, Arbuthnot, struck
up friendships with this and that musician at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
Queen&rsquo;s Arms Tavern in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard and
was never so happy as when he sat with some musical
crony, a mug of beer at hand and a harpsichord nearby.
The first work he composed in the ideal peace of
Burlington House was a Birthday Ode for Queen Anne,
whom he had met on his first London visit. The Ode
was produced at St. James&rsquo;s on February 6, 1713, and
was the first English he had set to music. All his life
Handel&rsquo;s English remained bad, sometimes even grotesque,
and the incorrect accenting in his compositions
repeatedly betray his deficiencies in our tongue. Of
such faults the Birthday Ode has its full share, in spite
of which the Queen was so delighted with the work that
she settled on the composer an annual pension of 200
Pounds. He found it politic to write music for patriotic
purposes, and instantly complied with the sovereign&rsquo;s
command to supply a &ldquo;Te Deum&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Jubilate&rdquo; to
celebrate the Peace of Utrecht, both compositions
given at a solemn service at St. Paul&rsquo;s before the assembled
Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Queen Anne died on August 1, 1714, and for a
time the skies over Handel threatened to cloud; for
on the very day of her passing the Elector of Hanover
was proclaimed by the Secret Council King of England.
He arrived in London on September 20 and was
crowned George I at Westminster a month later. Here
was a pretty kettle of fish! His former master to whose
service he had most certainly not returned &ldquo;in a
reasonable time&rdquo; suddenly seated on the English
throne&mdash;and not even a new &ldquo;Te Deum&rdquo; prepared
against his coming to the land which Handel now
regarded as home!</p>
<p>Handelian luck got him out of what might have
been a serious predicament. He must have trusted to
his destiny in the first place to help him out of an
obviously awkward situation and, being tactful, he
made no open move to aggravate it. George I was and
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
remained intensely German, brought to England with
him &ldquo;a compact body of Germans&rdquo;&mdash;chamberlains,
secretaries, even his pair of elderly mistresses, the
Baroness Kielmansegge and Madame Schulenburg;
and all manner of comforts and consolations he could
not find in his new island kingdom. He made no
effort to shed his German love of music, wherefore
as Rolland points out, &ldquo;he could not punish Handel
without punishing himself.&rdquo; And after he heard
Handel&rsquo;s fascinating new opera, &ldquo;Amadigi&rdquo;, in May,
1715, he lost all idea (if, indeed, he ever harbored
any) of disciplining his former servant. He appointed
Handel music master to the little princesses and when,
in 1716, the monarch had to go to Hanover the composer
accompanied him on the trip, took occasion to
study musical developments in Germany and even
wrote a Passion on a text by Heinrich Brockes.</p>
<p>Here is the point to consider for a moment the tale
of the &ldquo;Water Music&rdquo;, one of the most venerable
Handelian anecdotes. The story runs somewhat as
follows: Lord Burlington and Baron Kielmansegge,
the Master of the King&rsquo;s Horse, in order to reconcile
sovereign and musician, in 1715 persuaded the latter
to write a set of light pieces to be played on a boat
close to the royal barge at a water party on the
Thames. The King liked the music sufficiently to
inquire who composed it and, being told, summoned
Handel, promised to let bygones be bygones and
received him back into favor. Unfortunately for
romance, later documents have shown that the &ldquo;Water
Music&rdquo; was not played till 1717 and then under wholly
different conditions. But the legend has become so
ingrained in British musical tradition that, as Newman
Flower wrote, &ldquo;it is precisely what ought to have
happened.&rdquo; At all events, the &ldquo;Water Music&rdquo; is an
adorable suite, definitely English in character&mdash;like
much else in Handel&rsquo;s music&mdash;and to this day an
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
ornament of concert programs in one or another
arrangement.</p>
<p>King George, far from remembering past annoyances,
saw to it that Handel&rsquo;s yearly pension from
Queen Anne should be increased to 600 Pounds, so
that even without further earnings his financial state
was tolerably secure. His good fortunes were enhanced
by the musical enthusiasms of the King, who could
not hear enough of &ldquo;Rinaldo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Amadigi&rdquo; (to the
spectacular features of which live birds, which sometimes
misbehaved, and a fountain of real water, heightened
the attractions of sumptuous settings). He
went to them, often incognito, several times a week
sharing his private box with his bevy of lady friends,
new and old; or he would vary his visits to the opera
with attendance at plays or concerts, so that his
chances to admire the works of Handel, in one form
or another, were rarely lacking. Many found that the
monarch&rsquo;s habit of parading his amours before London
audiences added to the piquancy of a Handelian
score!</p>
<p>By the side of the famed artificial soprano, Nicolini,
sang the brilliant Anastasia Robinson, who had been
a soprano but whose voice, after a siege of illness,
suddenly dropped to contralto. Mrs. Robinson was
particularly noted for the fact that her morals were
at all times spotless. Mrs. Delany was to describe her
as &ldquo;of middling stature, not handsome but of a pleasing
modest countenance, with large blue eyes....
Her manner and address were very engaging, and
her behavior on all occasions that of a gentlewoman.&rdquo;
When her husband, Lord Peterborough, died she
burned the diaries he had kept, wherein he had noted
his various infidelities and other secrets not meant for
the scrutiny of his wife.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Handel&rsquo;s star was steadily rising and his fame was
not to be transcended till a number of years later and
then only by virtue of his own genius and after many
fluctuations of fortune. But when the King returned
to London from his trip to Germany opera fell upon
bad days. Musical and theatrical life flourished, indeed,
yet suddenly farces and other diversions, imported
from France, captured the mood of the town
and delighted the monarch and his ladies. Now nobody
felt like putting up money on opera, since inexpensive
vulgarity was a safer bet. At just about this
period Handel and James Brydges, Duke of Chandos,
former Paymaster-General of the Army during the
Marlborough wars, were brought into contact. The
erstwhile Earl of Carnarvon had accumulated his
wealth by heaven knows what sharp practices, and
inherited an estate at Cannons, near Edgware, where
he had erected a luxurious palace, including a chapel,
a theatre, and other musical appurtenances inseparable
from such an establishment. The Prince of Wales
was a frequent visitor at Cannons, braving even the
swarming footpads of Edgware Road. The Duke of
Chandos seems to have been in a position to buy anything
which struck his fancy and there is a story that
on one occasion, he or his son (the accounts differ)
coming across a man unmercifully thrashing his well-favored
wife, rescued the lady by buying her on the
spot. He, therefore, had no particular trouble securing
Handel as master of his music in place of his
former employee, the German Dr. Pepusch. Some ten
years later Dr. Pepusch had his revenge by compiling
the score of the &ldquo;Beggar&rsquo;s Opera&rdquo; which was to become
such a grievous obstacle in Handel&rsquo;s path.</p>
<p>But until 1720 Handel was in the service of the
Duke of Chandos, even if he spent much of his time
in London, busily attending to the musical instruction
of the daughters of Caroline, Princess of Wales, and
writing numerous &ldquo;Lessons&rdquo; and clavier suites for his
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
royal pupils. Which brings us to another celebrated
Handelian fiction, &ldquo;The Harmonious Blacksmith.&rdquo; The
legend is quite as diversified and even more far-fetched
than the one about the &ldquo;Water Music.&rdquo; For
well over a century the world has been fed the story
of the blacksmith and his forge near Whitchurch,
close to Edgware. In the house of this blacksmith
Handel is supposed to have taken refuge from a
thunderstorm, the blacksmith meantime continuing
his hammering. When the storm was over the composer
went forth and, still haunted by the rhythm of
the pounding, set down the melody and then proceeded
to write variations on it. This &ldquo;Air and Variations&rdquo;
form part of Handel&rsquo;s Fifth Suite of clavecin pieces,
but it was not till 1820 that some imaginative publisher,
taking his cue from an apprentice who continually
whistled Handel&rsquo;s tune, invented the fanciful
title; and not till 1835 that the London <i>Times</i> published
an anonymous letter retailing the legend of the
blacksmith and his forge. We have no place here to
recount the complex ramifications of the amiable myth
which culminated in the auctioning off of an old anvil&mdash;supposedly
the very one which the composer heard
struck! But the publisher had the last word and to
the end of time the Fifth Suite will assuredly remain
&ldquo;The Harmonious Blacksmith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far more important in the development of Handel&rsquo;s
style are the &ldquo;Chandos Anthems&rdquo; (or Psalms), composed
during the years from 1717 to 1720 while the
master, at Cannons, was steadily evolving. They fill
three volumes of the Complete Handel edition and
&ldquo;stand in relationship to Handel&rsquo;s oratorios in the same
position as his Italian cantatas stand to his operas.
In these religious cantatas, written for the Duke&rsquo;s
chapel, Handel gives the first place to the chorus....
There is already in them the spirit and the style of
&lsquo;Israel in Egypt&rsquo;, the great monumental lines, the
popular feeling. It was only a step from this to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
colossal Biblical dramas.&rdquo; (Rolland) And Handel took
this first step with &ldquo;Esther&rdquo;, called in its first form
&ldquo;Haman and Mordecai, a masque.&rdquo; It was staged on
August 29, 1720. Almost simultaneously he wrote the
exquisite pastoral tragedy, &ldquo;Acis and Galatea&rdquo;, a
Sicilian legend he had already treated during his
Neapolitan days but which, in its later shape took on
an unsurpassable element of classical finish.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Yet there were breakers ahead! Whether or not he
could discern them from afar it is probably unlikely
that the prospect of conflict would have troubled over
much a nature as powerful and combative as Handel&rsquo;s.
Indeed, difficulties were what this prodigious vitality
and ever renewing creative inspiration best throve
upon. As so often happens in lands where opera is
fundamentally an exotic people again wanted opera.
It was a logical time to end the Cannons interlude.
The psychology of the moment, to which Handel was
sensitive, came just when company-promoting took
on almost the aspect of a hobby. There was money
aplenty and the South Sea Bubble, which was indeed
swelling, had not yet burst. So Lord Burlington and
other peers raised capital for a new season of Italian
opera, appointed Handel director-in-chief, made the
ugly but efficient Heidegger stage manager, rounded
up librettists and sent Handel to the Continent to engage
singers for what was to be known as &ldquo;The Royal
Academy of Music&rdquo;&mdash;an English duplication of the
official name of the Paris Op&eacute;ra. And the <i>Weekly
Journal</i> soon announced that &ldquo;Mr. Handel, a famous
Master of Musick, is gone beyond the sea, by order of
His Majesty, to collect a company of the choicest
singers for the Opera in the Haymarket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Handel&rdquo; visited Hanover, D&uuml;sseldorf, Dresden
and Halle, where he went to his birthplace &ldquo;Am
Schlamm&rdquo;, saw his old mother, who was going blind,
and her aging spinster sister. And at this point occurred
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
one of the most poignant incidents of musical
history&mdash;that meeting of Handel and Bach, thwarted
by an inscrutable destiny. Bach learned that his contemporary
was in Halle, went there on foot from Coethen
to seek him out and&mdash;missed him by a day!
Even Bach&rsquo;s subsequent dispatch of his son, Wilhelm
Friedemann, to invite Handel to visit him misfired and
the two were destined forever to remain personal
strangers.</p>
<p>Handel secured some extraordinary singers in Dresden,
where the Italian opera was blooming. In addition
to Boschi, the bass, who had sung in &ldquo;Rinaldo&rdquo;, he
bagged the great Signora Durastanti and the castrato
Senesino, who until the subsequent coming of the
mighty Farinelli, was perhaps the artificial soprano
whom London most worshipped at a time when castrati
were completely the rage. Senesino played
incredible havoc with the hearts of deluded women.
Handel, in addition to the countless duties of a music-director
had also operas to compose, and in due season
he was somehow turning out three a year. Nicola
Francesco Haym supplied him with a libretto adapted
from Tacitus, &ldquo;Radamisto&rdquo;, and this work, produced
on April 27, 1720, was a triumph such as even Handel
had never experienced. It ran till the season ended late
in June; &ldquo;crowds flocked to &lsquo;Radamisto&rsquo; like a modern
mob to a notorious prize-fight.&rdquo; (Newman Flower)</p>
<p>The first season of the Royal Academy finished in a
flourish, aided by the circumstance that the metropolis
was in the throes of an orgy of financial speculation.
We can read of incredible schemes and &ldquo;bubbles&rdquo; with
the help of which money was to be lured from private
pocket-books. Newman Flower tells of &ldquo;one for trading
in hair, another for the universal supply of funerals
in Great Britain, one for a wheel of perpetual motion,
one &lsquo;for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage,
but nobody to know what it is&rsquo;.&rdquo; Still another
project contemplated &ldquo;breeding silkworms in Chelsea
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
Park.&rdquo; By the time things were ready for the opening
of the Academy&rsquo;s second season Lord Burlington imported
from Rome the composer Giovanni Battista
Bononcini, possibly not dreaming that he was introducing
a dangerous rival to Handel. In his little way
Bononcini had talent and charm, as well as a conceit
out of all proportion to his pleasant gifts. An opera
of his was produced at the Academy with Senesino
in the cast and enjoyed a good run, while a composite
work, called &ldquo;Muzio Scevola&rdquo;, with one act
by Handel, another by Bononcini and a third by a
mediocrity, Filippo Mattei, followed. The results of
the increasingly complicated situation were to precipitate
a contest that split London&rsquo;s high society into
factions. The cynical John Byrom compressed it into
an epigram, part of which has entered the English
language:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Some say, compared to Bononcini,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>That Mynherr Handel&rsquo;s but a ninny;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Others aver that he to Handel</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Is scarcely fit to hold a candle.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Strange, all this difference should be</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>&rsquo;Twixt Tweedledum and Tweedledee.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Be all of which as it may, Handel presently had the
mortification of seeing his own new &ldquo;Floridante&rdquo; fail
while Bononcini&rsquo;s pretty &ldquo;Griselda&rdquo; packed the theatre
like nothing since &ldquo;Radamisto!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Handel resembled the mythical Antaeus, who
whenever he fell renewed his own powers by contact
with Mother Earth. Before long he was turning out
masterpieces in bewildering continuity. In 1723 he
composed the superb &ldquo;Ottone&rdquo;, in 1724 &ldquo;Tamerlano&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Giulio Cesare&rdquo; and the following season the
sumptuous &ldquo;Rodelinda&rdquo;; in 1726 &ldquo;Scipione&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;Alessandro&rdquo;, in 1727 &ldquo;Admeto&rdquo; and &ldquo;Riccardo I&rdquo;, in
1728 &ldquo;Siroe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tolomeo.&rdquo; This period, incidentally,
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
brings us to those excesses of singer worship and
rivalry which stirred the public to white heat and
turned the opera house into something between a wild
prize fight and a three ring circus. Then, in 1722-23,
the species <i>prima donna</i> suddenly invaded the scene,
in the person of Francesca Cuzzoni, who was squat
and ungainly, but had an astounding voice and an art
of song that made high society overlook her bad temper
and her worse style in dress. Handel had occasion
to experience her tantrums at the rehearsals of
&ldquo;Ottone&rdquo;, when she refused to sing an aria as the composer
wanted it; whereupon he had recourse to real
&ldquo;Taming of the Shrew&rdquo; tactics, seized her bodily and
threatened to throw her out of the window, at the
same time shouting to her in French: &ldquo;Oh, Madame,
I know full well that you are a real she-devil; but I intend
to teach you that I am Beelzebub, the Chief of
Devils!&rdquo; Whereupon the humbled Cuzzoni sang her
&ldquo;Falsa imagine&rdquo; exactly as Handel wanted. Possibly
the incident did not end Handel&rsquo;s difficulties with her
but in her relations with him she became more tractable
and if she could not subdue the insensitive master
she did subdue her audiences. &ldquo;Damme, she has a nest
of nightingales in her belly!&rdquo;, yelled one of the gallery
gods on a certain occasion and the plebeian indelicacy
seems to have won the approval of the boxes. Soon
Anastasia Robinson, revolted by the turmoil over
Cuzzoni, retired from stage life and married the Earl
of Peterborough.</p>
<p>Cuzzoni, however, was only one obstacle of her
kind. Soon afterwards the management, on the lookout
for another sensation, secured the soprano&rsquo;s most
hated Continental rival, Faustina Bordoni, who was to
become the wife of the composer Hasse. Handel
brought the pair on the stage together in his opera
&ldquo;Alessandro&rdquo;. Lady Pembroke was &ldquo;protectress&rdquo; of
Cuzzoni, Lady Burlington of Faustina. Finally, in
May, 1727, things culminated when the two jealous
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
creatures came to blows during a performance of
Bononcini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Astyanax&rdquo;, tore each others hair and
pummeled one another in full view of the spectators,
who took sides and shrieked with delight as the
coiffures of the combatants were ruined and faces
scratched. The &ldquo;fighting cats&rdquo;, as the pair were called,
later were made the subject of Colley Cibber&rsquo;s farce,
&ldquo;The Rival Queens&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In time Cuzzoni despite her lack of taste in dressing
was to set fashions; and a brown and silver attire in
which she appeared in &ldquo;Rodelinda&rdquo; so captivated the
ladies that, with modish variations, it was to be the
rage for years. The various castrati (notably the great
Senesino) were in many ways as capricious and difficult
to manage as the prima donnas. Senesino, having
irritated the Earl of Peterborough by reason of some
reflection on Anastasia Robinson was flogged by her
husband. The scandal enchanted the drawing rooms
and Society was even more delighted when the singer,
appearing in &ldquo;Giulio Cesare&rdquo; was frightened out of his
wits and burst into tears because a piece of scenery
fell at his feet at the very moment when, as Julius
Caesar, he had to sing words to the effect that &ldquo;Caesar
knows no fear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In time came the greatest castrato of them all, the
incredible Farinelli, who earned so much in London
that when he retired to Italy he built himself a palace
there which he sarcastically named &ldquo;English Folly&rdquo;.
People used to shout at the Opera that there was only
&ldquo;One God and one Farinelli!&rdquo; And describing a London
birthday party where this divinity was among the
guests the Duchess of Portland wrote: &ldquo;There were
about forty gentlemen that had an entertainment, and
Farinelli wore a magnificent suit of clothes, and
charmed the company with his voice as Orpheus did
(and so kept them from drinking).&rdquo; On the other
hand when this god was once so imprudent as to
walk uninvited into a party at the Duke of Modena&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
in St. James&rsquo;s Street the infuriated host showed him
the door with the words: &ldquo;Get out, fellow! None but
gentlemen come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All these scandals, spectacular squabbles and silly
exhibitions did not, in the long run, enhance the credit
of the Academy. Handel, who had been naturalized on
February 13, 1726 and at the same time been appointed
Composer to the Court and to the Chapel
Royal, was together with the rest of London, shocked
in the early summer of 1727, to learn of the death
of George I on a trip to Germany. On October 11
of the same year George II was crowned and, though
less favorably disposed to the composer than his father,
continued the pensions Handel held from the late
sovereign and from Queen Anne and contributed to
them another large sum for music lessons to the
young princesses. Handel, for his part, wrote for the
new King four Coronation Anthems which added
to his glory. The Academy, after losing an appalling
amount of money presently received its death blow,
the production at the theatre in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields
of &ldquo;The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera&rdquo;, by the clever satirist, John
Gay, with music compiled by Dr. Pepusch, Handel&rsquo;s
predecessor in the employ of the Duke of Chandos.
This &ldquo;ballad opera&rdquo;, that &ldquo;made Gay rich and Rich,
the manager, gay&rdquo;, which still leads a lusty existence,
and has been at various times a landmark in English
and American theatrical history, proved an earthy and
bawdy entertainment, against the barbed shafts of
whose ridicule the artifices of Italian opera could not
prevail for long.</p>
<p>Yet Handel remained incorrigible. Once again he
entered into partnership with Heidegger, planned
another opera season, secured Senesino again and
went abroad to engage other singers. On that occasion
he traveled again to Italy, went to Hamburg and made
a last visit to his aged mother in Halle. She was now
paralyzed, and shortly afterwards she died. The new
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
London opera season got off to a bad start, one failure
succeeding another. Politics aggravated the situation,
the more so as George II and the Prince of Wales were
at odds and the supporters of the latter, determined to
set up a rival opera company to ruin Handel.</p>
<p class="tb">But the story of Handel&rsquo;s pertinacious efforts to
float new operatic enterprises for almost another ten
years is too long, involved and too honeycombed with
intrigue, contending influences and low tactics of one
sort or another to be examined here. The composer&rsquo;s
Hanoverian origin stirred many parties against him.
Moreover, he was a self-willed, imperious person,
who, like Richard Wagner more than a century later,
had the gift of stimulating antagonism. He was, wrote
W. McNaught, &ldquo;a pervading presence, a busybody
forever intruding upon public affairs. He had taken
to ordering the amusements of the town in his own
interests; and he belonged to the wrong party.&rdquo; One
almost fancies oneself confronted with a chapter from
the life of the creator of &ldquo;Die Meistersinger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet what a treasury of glorious music Handel was
pouring out with incalculable lavishness during these
agitated years! Let us mention in passing a few of the
new operas as they came and went: &ldquo;Ezio&rdquo;, &ldquo;Orlando&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Il Pastor Fido&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ariodante&rdquo;, &ldquo;Alcina&rdquo;, &ldquo;Arminio&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Berenice&rdquo;, &ldquo;Faramondo&rdquo;, &ldquo;Serse&rdquo;. The last-named
calls for a word by itself. &ldquo;Xerxes&rdquo; has nothing to do
with the Persian ruler of antiquity. It is a comic
opera, Handel&rsquo;s first and only one, which stands up
extraordinarily well under modern stylized conditions
of revival, apart from which it contains possibly one
of the most universally beloved melodies that Handel
ever wrote. This melody, heard at the very opening
of the piece, appears in the score as a <i>larghetto</i> to the
words &ldquo;Ombra mai fu&rdquo;, a song of gratitude to a plane
tree for its beneficent shade. But for generations it has
been slowed from the pace originally prescribed to a
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
solemn, swelling hymn known to uncounted millions
as &ldquo;Handel&rsquo;s Largo.&rdquo; And far more know it as a
churchly canticle than its lightly moving operatic context.
Almost every one of this mass of operas, furthermore,
is charged with grand arias of all the emotional
varieties common to its epoch&mdash;gems enshrined in
practically every one of the great anthologies of the
18th Century song.</p>
<p>It was not till 1741 that Handel concluded his
period of operatic creativity with &ldquo;Deidamia&rdquo;, written
to a libretto by Paolo Rolli. London&rsquo;s taste for opera
had, during more than a decade shown continued
fluctuation. But in 1731 a new situation brought about
an event that was to provoke a development of capital
importance for Handel&rsquo;s future. The children of the
Chapel Royal presented in a private performance his
masque, &ldquo;Esther&rdquo;, on the composer&rsquo;s birthday. The
success of the performance was such that it resulted
in others, one of which was given without Handel&rsquo;s
consent by one of his rivals. The master was equal
to the occasion. He added some numbers to the score
and gave half a dozen representations at the King&rsquo;s
Theatre; but as a Biblical subject could not be acted
on the stage the masque was given in concert form,
in the presence of the royal family and of High
Society. The Handelian oratorio had more or less
come into being!</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>In the summer of 1733 Handel went to Oxford.
The University authorities had offered him a degree
of Doctor of Music. Oxford is said to have known
little of his music at that time. Yet his arrival there
might, according to Newman Flower, &ldquo;have been the
triumphant entry of a king. The town was overcrowded;
even accommodations at the hostels ran out
and people slept in the streets.&rdquo; The composer brought
with him a new oratorio, &ldquo;Athalia&rdquo;, composed to a
text which Samuel Humphreys had adapted from
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Racine. Hugo Leichtentritt claims that the Rector,
Dr. Holmes, aimed to bring about a rapprochement
between the Hanoverians and the Jacobites. A whole
week of Handelian works was offered, with hearings
of &ldquo;Esther&rdquo;, &ldquo;Deborah&rdquo;, &ldquo;Athalia&rdquo;, the Utrecht Te
Deum, &ldquo;Acis and Galatea&rdquo; and other creations. In
the end the master did <i>not</i> receive the honorary
degree. Some have believed that he turned it down
when he was told it would cost 100 Pounds. Like
Haydn half a century after, he found the academic
honors of Oxford expensive; and later a story gained
currency that Handel had shouted in his particular
brand of English: &ldquo;Vat de dyfil I trow away my
money for what de Blockhead wish; I no vant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had it been practical he might have brought a
whole opera production to Oxford. In place of such
a luxury he compromised on oratorios, the more so
because the dividing line between such entertainment
and the opera of the period was not so sharply drawn
as it was eventually to become. The chief differences
between the two forms lay in the preponderance of
choruses, such as, in opera, were regarded as hardly
more than side issues.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he seemed unable to resist the lure of
the theatre. Again and again he returned to Italian
opera. He continued his earlier partnership with Heidegger;
he made trips to Italy and elsewhere and
secured new singers (the castrato, Carestini, the prima
donna, Strada). His enemies increased in number and
power and resorted to the basest tactics imaginable to
discredit and injure him. The so-called Opera of the
Nobility opened at a playhouse in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields,
lured his singers away from him by fair means or
foul, and by securing the great Farinelli obtained a
trump card. Handel (who in time parted company
with Heidegger) would burn his fingers the moment
his fortunes seemed on the upgrade. Even the weather
was against him, what with the Thames freezing over
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
in one of the years that he obstinately returned to
opera and cutting down his audiences. He lost money
ruinously, he went into bankruptcy, he wore himself
out to such a degree that he had a mental and physical
breakdown and had to go to the Continent, to Aix-la-Chapelle,
for a cure. His amazing resilience of spirit
and body helped him back to health and actually
encouraged him to make another attempt at an operatic
season with his egregious associate, Heidegger,
at the King&rsquo;s Theatre early in 1738, for which he
composed his comedy, &ldquo;Serse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few months earlier his royal friend, Queen Caroline,
had died and Handel gave voice to his genuine
grief in the great Funeral Anthem, &ldquo;The Ways of
Zion do Mourn.&rdquo; And despite his misfortunes he
busied himself with a charitable enterprise, the promotion
of a Society for the Support of Decayed Musicians,
which enlisted his active sympathies for the
rest of his life. Not even benefactions of the sort
could mollify the legions of his implacable enemies.
His aristocratic foes, to hasten his complete downfall,
actually hired hoodlums to tear down his posters and
precipitate noisy disturbances whenever they thought
trouble-making could in some way or other harm him.
Yet a few friends stood unshakably by his side, none
more faithfully than the loyal Mrs. Delany.</p>
<p>Just when his creditors had seized him and threatened
him with imprisonment the news of his tribulations
gave rise to a popular movement of sympathy.
In 1735 he had delighted the English public by his
&ldquo;Alexander&rsquo;s Feast&rdquo;, composed on Dryden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ode to
St. Cecilia&rdquo;, produced triumphantly at the Covent
Garden Theatre. It had been written in twenty days.
As the years passed, Handel&rsquo;s composing activity
seemed incredibly accelerated. In the freezing winter
of 1739 he wrote, &ldquo;to keep himself warm&rdquo; (as Rolland
says) the &ldquo;little&rdquo; Cecilia cantata in a week, the version
of Milton&rsquo;s poem (under the title &ldquo;L&rsquo;Allegro, Il Penseroso
ed Il Moderato&rdquo;) in just under a fortnight,
and the glorious Concerti Grossi, Opus 6, in a month
distracted by his last operatic cares! Incidentally,
Handel had received about this time a testimonial of
public admiration in the form of a marble statue by
the sculptor, Roubiliac, which a manager of musical
entertainments named Tyers had caused to be erected
in Vauxhall Gardens, a meeting place of London
Society, where Handel&rsquo;s works made up the best liked
musical features.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Still, by the spring of 1741, Handel in a moment of
profoundest disheartenment prepared to throw up the
sponge and leave for good and all his home for the
past thirty years. At long last he was fed up on the
struggle and announced one last concert for April 8,
1741. And then, when the darkness before dawn
seemed blackest, he sat down to create his masterpiece,
the most universally beloved choral work ever
composed!</p>
<p>That summer Charles Jennens gave Handel a compilation
of Scriptural texts which he called &ldquo;Messiah.&rdquo;
Jennens was a literary amateur, born at Gopsall Hall,
Leicestershire and educated at Balliol College, Oxford.
Rich and bizarre, he was vastly conceited and
especially proud of the manner in which he had
assembled the various Biblical texts used in this case.
Handel had been associated with him before&mdash;in the
oratorio, &ldquo;Saul&rdquo; (1739), and in &ldquo;L&rsquo;Allegro ed Il
Penseroso&rdquo; a year later, as a supplement to which
he had added some poor verses of his own to the
lines of Milton and called the product &ldquo;Il Moderato.&rdquo;
Robert Manson Myers thinks it &ldquo;extraordinary that
Handel turned to this eccentric millionaire for his
libretto of &lsquo;Messiah&rsquo;.&rdquo; Jennens was of another mind
and even later wrote to an acquaintance: &ldquo;I shall
show you a collection I gave Handel, called &lsquo;Messiah&rsquo;
which I value highly; he has made a fine entertainment
of it, though not near so good as he might and ought
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
to have done.... There are some passages far unworthy
of Handel, but even more unworthy of &lsquo;Messiah&rsquo;&rdquo;;
and deploring Handel&rsquo;s &ldquo;maggots&rdquo; he added
that he had &ldquo;with greatest difficulty made him correct
some of the grossest faults in the composition.&rdquo; Doubtless
Handel, had he so chosen, could have picked his
texts himself; he compiled the book of &ldquo;Israel in
Egypt&rdquo; unaided in 1738 and when, a good deal earlier,
the Bishop of London wanted to help him with the
words for the &ldquo;Coronation Anthems&rdquo; he retorted:
&ldquo;I have read my Bible very well, and I shall choose
for myself!&rdquo; Mr. Myers, in his encyclopedic study
of &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; feels certain that Handel must have
controlled the choice of passages selected.</p>
<p>Like Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Schubert and other
supreme musicians Handel could create with a rapidity
which ignominiously shames composers of our
supposedly &ldquo;speedy&rdquo; age. Even bearing that fact in
mind, the composition of &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; between Saturday,
August 22, 1741, and Monday, September 14,
following remains one of the miracles of music. Shut
up in a little room on the first floor of his home on
Lower Brook Street, Hanover Square, none can say
exactly what went on. Handel is supposed to have
uttered afterwards the words of St. Paul: &ldquo;Whether
I was in my body or out of my body as I wrote it
I know not.&rdquo; Nobody seems to have dared intrude
upon this mystic concentration. Food was left near
him but usually found untouched when the servant
came to remove it. He sat at his desk like a stone
figure and stared into space. Sometimes his man stood
in awe to see his master&rsquo;s tears drop on the music
paper and mingle with the ink. &ldquo;When he was composing
&lsquo;He was despised&rsquo; a visitor is reported to have
found the trembling composer sobbing with intense
emotion.&rdquo; And after the &ldquo;Hallelujah Chorus&rdquo; he
uttered those historic words: &ldquo;I did think I did see
all Heaven before me, and the great God Himself!&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
The autograph score, with its blots, its angry erasures
and general untidiness, offers fierce evidence of his
tumultuous feelings and flaming ecstasies. Possibly
between April and late August of 1741 he was shut
up in his four walls planning the work, for we have
no clear idea just what he did during this period.
Sketches and fragments do not clear up what mystery
there may be, for the composer destroyed all but some
fugitive scraps.</p>
<p>Handel appears to have &ldquo;been reluctant to submit
such music to the capricious taste of aristocratic London.&rdquo;
So when William Cavendish, Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland, invited him to visit Dublin and permit
the public of &ldquo;that generous and polite Nation&rdquo; hear
his oratorios Handel assented at once, the more so
because it was a question of assisting three benevolent
institutions of Ireland (one of them the Charitable
Musical Society for the Relief of Imprisoned Debtors).
With his usual impulsiveness he even agreed to
present &ldquo;some special oratorio&rdquo; solely for the benefit
of the unfortunates jailed for debt. And he was happy
to shake the dust of London from his feet for a while.
Before starting on his Irish journey, incidentally, he
composed in a fortnight part of another oratorio,
&ldquo;Samson&rdquo;, based on Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Samson Agonistes&rdquo; and
containing that noble air of lament, &ldquo;Total Eclipse&rdquo;,
which was to affect him so poignantly some years
later. For his Dublin productions he had two exceptional
woman singers&mdash;Susannah Maria Cibber (also
an illustrious tragic actress) and Signora Avolio, a
highly trained Italian. The chorus was recruited from
Dublin&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral and Christchurch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; did not receive its first hearing till April
13, 1742. Reports emanating from the last rehearsals
greatly whetted public appetite and on the morning
of April 13 <i>Faulkner&rsquo;s Journal</i> ran the following:
&ldquo;This day will be performed Mr. Handell&rsquo;s new Grand
Sacred Oratorio, called the Messiah. The doors will be
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
opened at Eleven, and the performance begin at
Twelve. The Stewards of the Charitable Musical
Society request the favor of the ladies not to come
with hoops this day to the Musick Hall in Fishamble
Street. The Gentlemen are desired to come without
their swords.&rdquo; Mr. Myers relates that &ldquo;Handel&rsquo;s &lsquo;polite&rsquo;
audience comprised &lsquo;Bishops, Deans, Heads of the
Colledge, the most eminent People in the Law, as
well as the Flower of Ladyes of Distinction and other
People of the greatest quality.&rsquo;&rdquo; The audience was
transported. In some ways the heroine of the occasion
was Mrs. Cibber, who sang the air &ldquo;He was despised&rdquo;
with such tenderness and pathos that the Reverend
Patrick Delany, who had harbored a bitter prejudice
against actresses and singers so far forgot himself
that he rose and solemnly exclaimed: &ldquo;Woman, for
this be all thy sins forgiven thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was late in August, 1742, before Handel returned
to London. The hostility of the English aristocracy
was still strong and continued for some years, although
the forceful voice of Alexander Pope had been raised
in his favor, little as that poet is said to have known
about music. But Pope&rsquo;s acknowledged belief in Handel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;talent&rdquo; did something toward disarming the
composer&rsquo;s enemies. However, he was in no hurry to
let London hear &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; in spite of all the great
things spoken and written about it. Not till February,
1743, did Handel plunge once more into the eddies
of music-making in the metropolis&mdash;not, indeed, with
operatic schemes as of old but with a plan for a series
of subscription concerts at Covent Garden, offering
&ldquo;Samson&rdquo; as the first attraction.</p>
<p>He took his time before bringing forward &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo;.
Even before he could advertise it his hypocritical
foes in fashionable circles began a campaign
against the &ldquo;profanation&rdquo; and the &ldquo;pious&rdquo; raised loud
cries; clergymen in particular were scandalized &ldquo;at
the sacrilege of converting the Life and Passion of
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
Christ into a theatrical entertainment.&rdquo; Even the idea
of printing the word <i>Messiah</i> on a program led Handel
to the expedient of announcing his great work simply
as &ldquo;A Sacred Oratorio.&rdquo; At that, the embattled clerics
tried to enjoin the performance &ldquo;on the ground that
Covent Garden Theatre was a place of worldly amusement
and that in any case public entertainments during
Lent were sacrilegious.&rdquo; However, the &ldquo;Sacred
Oratorio&rdquo; was at last given its first London hearing
on March 23, 1743. The composer conducted, Signora
Avolio, Mrs. Cibber, John Beard and Thomas Lowe
were the chief soloists. And here let us cite once more
Robert Manson Myers&rsquo; superb study of the masterpiece:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the glorious strains of the &lsquo;Hallelujah Chorus&rsquo;
burst upon the awed assemblage, thick-witted George
II found himself so deeply affected by Handel&rsquo;s music
(or so eager to shift his position) that he started to
his feet with all the spontaneous verve a sixty-year-old
gout-ridden monarch could muster. Instantly his
phlegmatic courtiers also rose, and since no Englishman
may remain seated while his King is standing,
the audience at once followed suit, thus inaugurating
a custom which persists to the present day. Actually
the King&rsquo;s gesture was more a tribute to Handel&rsquo;s
impressive music than an instance of exceptional
religious devotion....</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a curious indication of public taste that this
casual Eighteenth Century &lsquo;fashion&rsquo; has remained for
two centuries an inviolable tradition both in England
and in America. Even today thousands who can
scarcely distinguish F sharp from middle C punctiliously
observe a custom established by a stupid
Hanoverian king and his worldly court two hundred
years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks to bigotry and organized religiosity, however,
&ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; had only three performances in 1743,
none in 1744, two in 1745 and none whatever till
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
four years later. Newman Flower recounts that the
master, being complimented on the work by a titled
hearer, replied: &ldquo;My lord, I should be sorry if I only
entertained people; I wished to make them better.&rdquo;
Yet as late as 1756 a Miss Catherine Talbot, one of
Handel&rsquo;s most devoted admirers, could say that &ldquo;the
playhouse is an unfit place for such a solemn performance.&rdquo;
However, in the words of Robert Manson
Myers, &ldquo;England&rsquo;s early rejection of &lsquo;Messiah&rsquo; may
be ascribed as much to personal resentment as to
shallow musical taste.... Handel flaunted his independence
and moved with resolute determination,
snapping his fingers in the face of princely patrons
and daring to defy the bluest blood in England. What
was to be done with this insufferable German upstart,
this mere musician, who despite persistent opposition
succeeded in discharging his debts to the uttermost
farthing? Chosen leaders of British &lsquo;quality&rsquo; resolved
to crush Handel at once. They devised a systematic
campaign to boycott his oratorios, and no scheme
proved too petty for the gratification of their spite.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * *</span></p>
<p>Vain resolve! For Handel, crushed, had a most
persistent habit of rising again. If political cabals
brought him low, the tides of national politics brought
him to the top once more. &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo;, to be sure, was
not to become an unshakable British (shall we not
rather say Anglo-Saxon) monument till after the composer&rsquo;s
death; yet Handel was able to make the most,
creatively, of the great national emergencies of his
last decade. In 1743, as Composer of Music to the
Chapel Royal, he wrote a &ldquo;Te Deum&rdquo; and an anthem
to celebrate the victory of Dettingen, music that conquered
the popular heart. To this period belongs the
charming secular oratorio, &ldquo;Semele&rdquo;, (source of the
beloved airs &ldquo;Where&rsquo;er you walk&rdquo; and &ldquo;O Sleep, why
dost thou leave me?&rdquo;) at the first production of which
Mrs. Delany found it significant that &ldquo;there was no
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
disturbance in the playhouse.&rdquo; But the old habit of
launching operatic or concert enterprises was upon
him once more and again threatened to consume his
credit and his substance. Bankruptcy threatened.
Other oratorios, &ldquo;Hercules&rdquo;, &ldquo;Belshazzar&rdquo;, grand
masterpieces both of them, were given in 1745 to
dwindling audiences. Handel&rsquo;s health was imperiled.
Then came 1745, the Jacobite rising and the landing
in Scotland of the Pretender, Charles Edward. There
was consternation which culminated in the march of
the Highlander army on London. Loyally, the composer
identified himself with the national cause; to
celebrate the early defeats of the Jacobites he wrote
the &ldquo;Occasional Oratorio&rdquo;, a call to Englishmen to
resist the invader. But this occupies a less considerable
niche in history than &ldquo;Judas Maccabaeus&rdquo;, next to
&ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; perhaps the most popular of Handel&rsquo;s oratorios,
unless we choose to set above it the earlier
&ldquo;Israel in Egypt&rdquo;&mdash;to Robert Schumann &ldquo;the model
of a choral work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judas Maccabaeus&rdquo;, the text of which a certain
divine, Thomas Morell, had based on the Old Testament,
was set by Handel between July 9 and August
11, 1746, was produced by Handel at Covent Garden,
April 1, 1747. The composer was extraordinarily
attuned to the emotional mood of the moment. People
saw in the heroic Judas an embodiment of the victorious
Duke of Cumberland, who had ferociously
scattered the hosts of the Pretender. And the Jews of
London, proud of the glorification of their warrior
hero of old, rallied to Handel&rsquo;s support and packed
the theatre in such numbers that the composer suddenly
found himself with a wholly new public at his
feet, which to some degree replaced for a time to
come the aristocratic patrons he had lost.</p>

<p class="caption">HANDEL&rsquo;S HOUSE, 1875.
<br />Handel lived here&mdash;then 57 Lower Brook Street, Hanover Square&mdash;for 34 years, 1725 till his death in 1759; &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; was composed within its walls.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>In the martial, heroic score of &ldquo;Judas Maccabaeus&rdquo;
Handel had incorporated some music he had originally
designed for other works. &ldquo;See the conquering hero
comes&rdquo;, probably the best known chorus in the oratorio,
had originally been a part of &ldquo;Joshua&rdquo;, and was
not heard in &ldquo;Judas Maccabaeus&rdquo; till a year after its
first production. Even the chorus &ldquo;Zion now her head
shall raise&rdquo;, was a later addition and had not been
composed till after Handel had lost his sight.</p>
<p>This is the place to comment briefly on Handel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;borrowings&rdquo; about which so much ado has been made
that one writer went so far as to allude to him as
&ldquo;the grand old thief.&rdquo; It is altogether too easy to lay
a disproportionate stress on the practice involved, the
more so as it was a fairly legitimate custom in the
Eighteenth Century. Besides Handel, masters like
Bach, Haydn, Gluck, Mozart and even Beethoven,
had a way, more or less frequently, of taking their
own where they found it. Often, indeed, they found
it in their own earlier creations. In any case no moral
or ethical question was involved, for the good reason
that the <i>treatment</i> of a theme or a melody according
to the esthetic of that period, mattered far more than
the phrase in question. Handel, when told of some
passage from another composer found in his music
had a way of retorting: &ldquo;The pig did not know what
to do with such a theme.&rdquo; Then, too, he adapted to
broader purposes music he had conceived earlier in
other connections. &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo;, for instance, offers
many cases in point. The chorus &ldquo;His yoke is easy,
His burthen is light&rdquo; was adapted for better or worse
from an Italian duet composed originally to the words
&ldquo;Quel fior che all&rsquo; alba ride&rdquo;; the great &ldquo;For unto us
a Child is born&rdquo;, was a madrigal denouncing &ldquo;Blind
Love and Cruel Beauty&rdquo; thus: &ldquo;No, di voi non vo&rsquo;
fidarmi&rdquo;, while &ldquo;All we like sheep have gone astray&rdquo;
was at first the Italian duet &ldquo;So per prova i vostri
inganni.&rdquo; The great ensemble, &ldquo;And with His Stripes&rdquo;,
employs the same fugal subject which Bach put to
use in the A minor fugue of the &ldquo;Well Tempered
Clavier&rdquo; and is also found in the Kyrie of Mozart&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
&ldquo;Requiem.&rdquo; But themes of this type were &ldquo;in the air&rdquo;
in that period and fairly recognized as general property.
It would be preposterous to labor too much the
points involved&mdash;the more so as every now and then
the practice is &ldquo;avenged&rdquo; (if we like!) by some awkwardness
of accent or clumsiness of declamation
which results by forcing the older phrase into a newer
textual association. Such things are very different from
the barefaced claim Bononcini once made to having
composed a certain work which, as it transpired, had
been written by a minor musician living in Vienna.
Then too, in the phrase of W. McNaught, &ldquo;Handel
did not borrow the thoughts of others; he rescued
them.&rdquo; And it must never be forgotten that men like
Bach and Handel faced deadlines unthinkable to any
musician of today!</p>
<p>Following &ldquo;Judas Maccabaeus&rdquo; Handel&rsquo;s fortunes
rose once more and after his conflicts with ill-will and
intrigue he was the incontestable victor. The consequence,
far from rest and relaxation, was another
stream of great works not all of them, unfortunately,
having become as familiar to posterity as they undoubtedly
deserve to be. Oratorios like &ldquo;Alexander
Balus&rdquo;, &ldquo;Susanna&rdquo;, &ldquo;Joshua&rdquo;, &ldquo;Solomon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jephtha&rdquo;,
treasurable as they are, are known to few, probably
because they are eclipsed by the gigantic shadows
cast by &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo;, &ldquo;Judas Maccabaeus&rdquo; or &ldquo;Israel in
Egypt.&rdquo; In 1749 he had written &ldquo;Theodora&rdquo;, which
failed. Its ill luck does not seem to have moved him
to more than a kind of &ldquo;wise-crack&rdquo; to the effect that
&ldquo;the Jews would not come to it because the story
was Christian and the ladies because it was virtuous.&rdquo;
In the same year he composed a scene from Tobias
Smollet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alceste&rdquo;, parts of which he later used in
his &ldquo;Choice of Hercules&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For the signing of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle
in 1748, the King demanded a showy festival, little
as there was to celebrate in the termination of a war
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
both unpopular and remote. Handel was commissioned
to compose music for an ostentatious show to
culminate in a grand display of fireworks in Green
Park, where a vast and grotesque wooden building,
surmounted by unsightly allegorical figures, had been
set up. Twelve thousand people foregathered for a
rehearsal of Handel&rsquo;s music, in Vauxhall Gardens,
and traffic as a result, was desperately tangled. At the
actual celebration everything went awry, the fireworks
fizzled and to provide a humiliating climax the edifice
in Green Park caught fire. Newman Flower tells in a
colorful account of the event that Handel had &ldquo;a
magnificent band worthy of the occasion ... forty
trumpets, twenty horns, sixteen hautboys, sixteen bassoons,
eight pair of kettledrums; for the first time he
introduced that forgotten instrument, the serpent into
his score, but took it out again.... He had for that
night as fine a band as he ever conducted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Handel&rsquo;s contribution, indeed, was the one indisputable
success of the occasion. He gave the bright
and sonorous &ldquo;Fireworks Music&rdquo; (a kind of companion
piece to the &ldquo;Water Music&rdquo;) the month after
the Green Park fiasco for the Foundling Hospital,
or &ldquo;The Hospital for the Maintenance and Education
of Exposed and Deserted Young Children.&rdquo; The
concert brought Handel the Governorship of the
institution.</p>
<p>The Foundling Asylum was a pride and pleasure to
Handel in his declining years. He presented it with a
new organ, opened it himself with a performance of
&ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; on May 1, 1750, when countless persons of
distinction had to be turned away since the Asylum
chapel accommodated only 1,000. From that time on
the master saw to it that the oratorio was sung there
every year and that the proceeds, always considerable,
were donated to the Hospital. Not to be behind his
great associate, the artist, Hogarth, who subsequently
shared with Handel the governorship, donated a portrait
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
he had painted to the Hospital, raffled it off and
gave the proceeds to the Asylum.</p>
<p>The composer went one last time to Halle and arrived
in Germany, Rolland points out, just at the time
his greatest contemporary, Bach, died in Leipzig. His
own health was deteriorating, though his mind remained
clear and his brain active. To be sure his sight
had begun to trouble him. Yet when Thomas Morell,
in January, 1751, gave him a libretto, &ldquo;Jephtha&rdquo;, he
set to work composing it at once. He who had turned
out the sublimities of &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; in four weeks and
the martial grandeurs of &ldquo;Judas Maccabaeus&rdquo; in even
less had, however, to break off for ten days after the
opening <i>Largo</i> of the chorus &ldquo;How dark, O Lord, are
Thy ways.&rdquo; And he painfully set down on the manuscript:
&ldquo;I reached here on Wednesday, February 13,
had to discontinue on account of the sight of my left
eye.&rdquo; On his 66th birthday (February 23) he wrote
&ldquo;Feel a little better. Resumed work&rdquo; and set the words
&ldquo;Grief follows joy as night the day.&rdquo; Then he stopped
for four months and did not complete the whole score
till the end of August, 1751. The last four numbers
had taken him more time than he usually spent on an
entire oratorio. By that time he had gone completely
blind.</p>
<p>Two years later he regained control of himself,
played the organ at twelve oratorio productions he
gave annually in Lent. He was, even, with the assistance
of his pupil and secretary, John Christopher
Smith, son of an old Halle school friend, to compose
some more music and to remodel his old Italian oratorio,
&ldquo;The Triumph of Time and Truth.&rdquo; He had submitted
to the care of a notorious quack, the &ldquo;opthalmiater&rdquo;
Chevalier John Taylor, who then enjoyed
an extensive vogue among distinguished patients
and who boasted that he had seen, on his travels, &ldquo;a
vast variety of singular animals, such as dromedaries,
camels, etc., and particularly at Leipsick, where a celebrated
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
master of musick (Bach) already arrived to
his 88th year (sic!) received his sight by my hands.&rdquo;
In any case, the different physicians hid nothing from
their patient. His case was hopeless, he was afflicted
with &ldquo;gutta serena&rdquo;. With his sight his best source of
inspiration was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man&rdquo;, said Romain Rolland, &ldquo;who was neither
an intellectual nor a mystic, one who loved above all
things light and nature, beautiful pictures and the
spectacular view of things, who lived more through
his eyes than most of the German musicians, was engulfed
in deepest night. From 1752 to 1759, he was
overtaken by the semi-consciousness which precedes
death.&rdquo; He had made his will in 1750 and at different
times in the next nine years he added codicils to it.
On April 6, 1759, he played the organ a last time at a
&ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; performance, broke down in the middle of
a number, recovered and improvised, it was said,
with his old-time magnificence. Then he was brought
home and they put him to bed.</p>
<p>Handel expressed a desire to be buried in Westminster
Abbey; and he said: &ldquo;I want to die on Good
Friday in the hope of rejoining the good God, my
sweet Lord and Saviour, on the day of His Resurrection.&rdquo;
On Saturday, April 14, 1759, the <i>Whitehall
Evening Post</i>, announced: &ldquo;This morning, a little
before eight o&rsquo;clock, died the deservedly celebrated
George Frederick Handell Esq.&rdquo; And a week later:
&ldquo;Last night about eight o&rsquo;clock, the remains of the
late great Mr. Handel were deposited at the foot of
the Duke of Argyll&rsquo;s Monument in Westminster
Abbey; and though he had mentioned being privately
interr&rsquo;d, yet from the Respect due to so celebrated a
Man, the Bishop, Prebends, and the whole Choir attended
to pay the last Honours due to his Memory;
the Bishop himself performed the Service. A Monument
is also to be erected for him, which there is no
doubt but his Works will even outlive. There was almost
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
the greatest Concourse of People of all Ranks
ever seen upon such, or indeed upon any other occasion.&rdquo;
Nevertheless, others have testified that Handel
was not &ldquo;burried midst a great concourse of people.&rdquo;
Ironically enough, the music performed at his obsequies
was &ldquo;Dr. Croft&rsquo;s Funeral Anthem.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">In the Poets&rsquo; Corner a rather mediocre monument,
by L. F. Roubiliac, was later unveiled to his memory
&ldquo;under the patronage and in the presence of His Most
Gracious Majesty, George III.&rdquo; But the lordly George
Frideric Handel might have been prouder of the
monument the dying Beethoven reared to his greatness
when, pointing to Arnold&rsquo;s Handelian edition by
his bed, he exclaimed: &ldquo;There lies the Truth!&rdquo;</p>
